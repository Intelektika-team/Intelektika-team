### **🌟 Welcome to Intelektika Team!**

We’re an innovative team from **Kvantorium (Dimitrovgrad)**, building open technologies for developers, engineers, and makers. Our mission is to make powerful tools accessible, versatile, and ready to use _"out of the box."_ We don’t just build computers — we create an **ecosystem**: from hardware platforms to libraries and software that unlock their full potential.

### **💡 Why Choose Us?**

| **Principle**    | **How It Works**                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ready-to-Run** | Hardware + software are tested together. Unbox — and start creating without hacks.                |
| **Openness**     | All code, schematics, and docs are public. Fork, modify, or integrate into your projects!         |
| **Modularity**   | Libraries work with our hardware _and_ platforms like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or ESP32.            |
| **Community**    | Uniting beginners, engineers, and researchers: joint hackathons, code reviews, and startup ideas. |

### **🧠 Philosophy**

> **"Tech shouldn’t be an elite club — it’s a tool for everyone."**  
> We fight complexity: our hardware has no pointless wires, our software has no hidden dependencies, and our docs speak _human_. Your projects should solve problems — not technical puzzles.
