# 🌟 Intelektika Team

We’re an innovative team from **Kvantorium (Dimitrovgrad)**, building open technologies for developers, engineers, and makers. Our mission is to make powerful tools accessible, versatile, and ready to use *"out of the box."* We don’t just build devices — we create an **ecosystem**: from hardware platforms to libraries and software that unlock their full potential.

## 🧠 Our Philosophy

> **"Tech shouldn't be an elite club — it's a tool for everyone."**
> We fight complexity: our hardware has no pointless wires, our software has no hidden dependencies, and our docs speak *human*. Your projects should solve problems — not technical puzzles.
