We’re an innovative team from **Kvantorium (Dimitrovgrad)**, building open technologies for developers, engineers, and makers. Our mission is to make powerful tools accessible, versatile, and ready to use *"out of the box."* We don’t just build devices — we create an **ecosystem**: from hardware platforms to libraries and software that unlock their full potential.

## 🔎 More more about our key projects

### Voxel — our programming language
We have created our own programming language inspired by the Brainfuck concept. Our goal is to make it complete and user—friendly. The syntax of the language is easy to understand, and it is also translated, which means that it is not just executed, but transformed into another language. In our case, it's Python. The language has its own command-line utility called vxl for working with projects. Example usage-
```
bash(echo //s Hello, //s World); //= Simple bash use;
bash(vxl //s -i //s html); //= Vxl install package usage;

<; >=2; +=2; +; -; out.now; //= Example tape usage;

//= Multi-line Python block;
:pyl-custom_logic-{
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com')
    print(response.status_code)
}; pylpaste(custom_logic); //= Use defined Python code;

out.str(Hello, //s World); //= Example output.string usage;
```

### Patch — programmable keyboard: an analog of Streamdeck for developers
Patch is a universal dashboard for developers that, thanks to an open ecosystem and a uniquely simple protocol for interacting with a computer, can perform almost any task. For example, you can specify in the driver that a script should be run when the 1 button is pressed.

## 🧠 Our Philosophy

> **"Tech shouldn't be an elite club — it's a tool for everyone."**
> We fight complexity: our hardware has no pointless wires, our software has no hidden dependencies, and our docs speak *human*. Your projects should solve problems — not technical puzzles.
